## Setup and Environment

Before diving into the code, ensure you have a proper C++ development environment set up on your machine.

- **Compilers**: You can use `g++`, `clang`, or any other standard C++ compiler.
- **IDE/Editors**: Recommended options include Visual Studio Code, CLion, or any text editor with C++ support.
- **Build Tools**: Make sure to have `make` or similar tools for building your projects.

### Getting Started

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed9588406/Cpp.git
cd cpp-basics
```

## Core Concepts

### 1. Variables and Data Types
Learn about different data types like `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and how to declare and use variables.

### 2. Operators
Understand various operators, including arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators.

### 3. Control Structures
Explore control structures like `if-else`, `switch-case`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), and their applications.

### 4. Functions
Get familiar with function declaration, definition, and overloading, along with examples of passing arguments by value and by reference.

### 5. Arrays and Strings
Understand how to work with arrays and strings, including multi-dimensional arrays and string manipulation.

## Object-Oriented Programming

### 1. Classes and Objects
Learn the basics of classes and objects, including how to create and use them.

### 2. Constructors and Destructors
Understand the role of constructors and destructors in managing object lifecycles.

### 3. Access Specifiers
Explore the use of `public`, `private`, and `protected` access specifiers in classes.

### 4. Inheritance and Polymorphism
Dive into inheritance and polymorphism, including method overriding and virtual functions.

### 5. Encapsulation and Abstraction
Understand the concepts of encapsulation and abstraction, and how they are implemented in C++.

## Memory Management

### 1. Pointers
Get comfortable with pointers, pointer arithmetic, and their applications in dynamic memory management.

### 2. Dynamic Memory Allocation
Learn how to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically using `new` and `delete`.

## File Handling

### 1. Reading and Writing Files
Explore file I/O operations, including reading from and writing to files using file streams.

### 2. File Streams
Understand the use of `ifstream`, `ofstream`, and `fstream` for managing file input and output.
